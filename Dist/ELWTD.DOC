 WHAT IS THINKDICE?

 ThinkDice is a simple but fun guessing game where users guess the result of
 a die roll, earning points for correct guesses and losing points for 
 incorrect guesses.  Users compete to get on the top ten list.
 
 GAMEPLAY
 
 ThinkDice is a simple game.  While playing, simply guess the result of a 
 single die's roll (guess 1 through 6).  You guess five times - each time,
 you score ten times the die roll for a correct answer, or lose twice the
 die roll for an incorrect answer.  
 
 Select "T" from the main menu for the top ten list.
 
 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
 
 Simply unzip the ThinkDice! game archive to your BBS server directory,
 add ThinkDice! to your menu, configure the MSG file to your liking, and start
 the BBS!  It's that easy! 
 
 GAME HISTORY
 
 ThinkDice! was originally written and developed by Rick Hadsall in 1989, and
 based upon his earlier DOS game of the same name. 

 The game was released as shareware for The Major BBS v5.x. It was shelved 
 until being revived along with many other modules in 2004. Then, it was ported 
 to The Major BBS 6.25/Worldgroup 1/Worldgroup 2 DOS format. In 2006, it was 
 ported to Worldgroup 3.2.  In 2023, it was ported to Major BBS V10. Finally,
 in 2024, its old text file top ten was converted to BTrieve.
